My friends birthdays

This app in mainly for me to remember all my friends birthdays. As a nowadays user I do not fill widely-used calendarbook and thats why I built an app where I can easely insert and later see all my friends birthdays. Later in the future there will be more features regarding alerts and so on.

Installation: Clone the MVC repo from Margohu Github and run 2 commands: first npm install to install dependencies and second one npm start to start the server. By default server starts in port 3000. So open the app, open http://localhost:3000 in Your browser.
