## My friends birthdays

## This app in mainly for me to remember all my friends birthdays. As a nowadays user I do not fill widely-used calendarbook and thats why I built an app where I can easely insert and later see all my friends birthdays. Later in the future there will be more features regarding alerts and so on.

## Installation: 
1. Clone the MVC repo from Margohu Github

3. Run npm start to start the server. By default server starts in port 3000.
4. To open the app, open http://localhost:3000 in Your browser.
